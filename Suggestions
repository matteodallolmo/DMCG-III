Suggestions:
Think about changing the keys so it is easier for users to play.
Instead of the ‘w’ key for jump, the space bar should be used.
Instead of the ‘a’ and ‘z’ for the left cheese, ‘a’ and ‘s’ should be used for left and right
Instead of ‘d’ and ‘c’ for the right cheese, ‘d’  and ‘f’ should be used for left and right
These changes allow the person to more effectively use one hand.
The numbers ‘1’ ‘2’ and ‘3’ can still be used for summoning
The big cheese should have 3 hearts and lose 1 heart for every trap encountered
The game should have levels as opposed to a high score.
The cheese can die from accumulating damage from traps and by falling off the platforms to its death.
